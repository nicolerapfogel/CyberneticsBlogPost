### Art Piece 1

The first piece I chose is “Surface” by Geoffrey Drake-Brockman, an Australian new media artist. The piece was created in 2016 and is an interactive inverted LED light pond permanently displayed in the central lobby of the Perth Children's Hospital. Drake-Broffman created his own software that uses 4 sensors to detect pedestrian motion below the installation. Motion sets off a virtual rock thrown into the light pond that sets off colorful ripples. It allows for multiple rippes at once, which creates a complex design beyond the simple ripple motion. At 10m by 5m, it is the largest interactive 3D LED light matrix in the world. As you can see in the video linked below, it creates a mesmerizing design that uplifts the healing nature of the hospital, yet remains playful enough to be enjoyed by children. I chose this piece because I became interested in ripple-based artwork in the algorithmic art section of the course, as I designed my own algorithmic ripples art piece. This work takes that algorithmic design to the next level, by using cybernetics to convert motion sensing data into a 3D interactive art piece.

The next piece I chose is "Nike+ Paint With Your Feet," a cybernetics piece created by the team YesYesNo featuring Zack Lierberman, Emily Gobeille, and Theo Watson. The work was comissioned by Nike for the launch of the Nike Free Run+2 City Pack series. The team developed software using openFrameworks v007b and Moka's ofxTileSaver addon. Participants at the workshop at Nike's headquarters recorded their runs. Using the software, the YesYesNo team imported the metrics and created visuals based on speed, consistency, and style of each person's run. The participants could then customize the mapping and composition of their run. They took home a print and the Nike Innovation Lab etched the runner's name, distance they ran, and run path onto a custom shoebox,containing the City Pack shoes from their home city.

I was drawn to this project because, as an avid runner, I've used the Nike+ software and other apps like it to track my mileage, speeds, and map the GPS coordinates of my running path. I've similarly tried visualizaions at track meets and running stores in high school that tracked my foot strike, pronation patterns, and other running metrics to find the right running shoe. At first glance, these images looked like abstract takes on the GPS coordinates of their run. However, I like how the software takes technical and important running metrics, like speed and style, and turns them into an abstract and personal image that participants were able to take with them.
